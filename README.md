## About

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data for an online retail store, aiming to provide valuable insights for the CEO and CMO. The goal is to support their decision-making process and facilitate the development of an expansion strategy. The project encompasses data cleanup, data visualization using Tableau or Power BI, and a comprehensive analysis of various aspects of the business, including revenue trends, operational efficiency, marketing effectiveness, and expansion opportunities.

## Data Cleanup

Before conducting any analysis, we meticulously cleaned and prepared the data to ensure its quality and reliability. This process included:

- Handling missing values.
- Removing duplicates.
- Addressing outliers.
- Verifying data accuracy.

## Data Visualization

For the data visualization phase, we employed Tableau, a powerful tool for creating compelling and interactive visuals. Here's how we used it:

- PowerBI as  data visualization tool.
- created a suite of visualizations, each carefully chosen to represent the data accurately.
- Visualizations included line charts, stacked bar charts, pie charts, radar charts, combo charts, waterfall charts, and dashboards, among others. Each served a specific purpose in presenting the data effectively.

## Analysis and Insights

Here addressed four key questions that were critical for the CEO and CMO:

1. **Revenue Trends Analysis:**
   - Presented a line chart depicting annual revenue trends. This chart helped identify overall revenue trajectory over the past year, highlighting any growth patterns or seasonality trends.

2. **Revenue Breakdown by Categories:**
   - Visualized revenue breakdown by product categories through stacked bar charts or pie charts, giving a clear understanding of which categories contributed the most to revenue.

3. **Operational Efficiency Analysis:**
   - Employed multi-axis line charts or radar charts to compare metrics like inventory turnover rate, order fulfillment time, and customer service response time over time. These charts helped assess operational efficiency and its changes.

4. **Marketing Effectiveness Analysis:**
   - Utilized combo charts for conversion rates and ROI, accompanied by separate bar charts for Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC). These visuals facilitated the assessment of marketing effectiveness, emphasizing conversion rates and ROI while considering CAC.

## Usage

The insights and visualizations provided here are instrumental for supporting the expansion strategy. The CEO and CMO can utilize these to:

- Identify high-performing product categories or regions for potential expansion.
